<h2>Input and Output</h2>
<p>The <strong>Input and Output</strong> tab page contains all the necessary
    information required to create a combined gpx layer from gpx files.
    The image below illustrates the form fields of the tab.
    In the image, the indicated fields that have astrix are required fields.
</p>
<img src="../../images/input_output_tab.png">
<p>The sub-topics below explains each form fields of the tab page. </p>
<h3>GPX Folder</h3>
<p>Choose the folder in which the gpx files reside
    by clicking on the Browser button. </p>
<h3>Scan Sub-folders</h3>
<p>Click on <strong>Yes</strong> to import gpx files in sub-folders or
    <strong>No</strong> to only import from the currently selected folder. </p>
<h3>GPX Format</h3>
<p>Choose one GPX format which could be track, waypoint, or route.
    This is determined during the GPS data collection. </p>
<h3>Layer Name</h3>
<p>Specify a name for the output layer.
    If not specified, the default layer will be used.</p>
<h3>Geometry Type</h3>
<p>Choose the geometry type of the output Layer.
    It can be Polygon, Line or Point. If you choose Polygon and Line,
    only the first attributes of each feature will be used. For Point
    geometry type, all point attributes are captured. </p>
<h3>Projection</h3>
<p>Choose the coordinate reference system used when collecting the GPS points.
    This will also be used as the layer projection. </p>
<h2>Validation</h2>
<p>The <strong>Validation</strong> tab enables you to filter out features with issues and map
    extent. It enables you to also save both gpx files with valid and invalid
    features based on the criteria you have supplied. The image below
    illustrates all the form fields of the Validation tab.

<p>The sub-topics below explains each form fields of the tab page. </p>
<h3>Exclude Outside Extent</h3>
<p>When this extent box is activated, it automatically captures the extent of
    the map. When you click on the Import button, this extent will be used to
    crop other features outside the visible map extent. </p>
<h3>Exclude with Geometry Errors</h3>
<p>Choose to exclude or include features with geometry error. If you click
    Yes, features with geometry error will be excluded and the error message
    and the gpx files will be shown in the log tab. </p>
<h3>Exclude with Insufficient Points</h3>
<p>Exclude or include GPX features with insufficient point that is not
    enough to create a valid geometry. This filter is applicable for lines
    and polygons. For line, the minimum points required are 2. For polygon,
    the minimum required points are 3. </p>
<p>If you click on the Yes radio button,
    features with points below the required number will be excluded.
    If you click on the No button, features with points below the
    required number will be included. This could lead to the presence features
    with no visible geometry.</p>
<h3>Valid GPX Folder</h3>
<p>If you would like to filter out and keep the valid gpx files used in
    the output layer. Select a folder. If not specified,
    the valid gpx files will not be copied.</p>
<h3>Invalid GPX Folder</h3>
<p>If you would like to identify invalid gpx files that are not used in
    the output layer. Select a folder. If not specified,
    the invalid gpx files will not be copied.</p>
<h2>Fields</h2>
<p>The <strong>Fields</strong> tab page contains the option to include and
    exclude fields that are extracted from the GPX file and additional fields
    added by Batch GPS Importer.</p>

<h3>Choose Layer Fields</h3>
<p>You can include or exclude layer fields that will be added in the map.
    If you remove the check of a field, it will not be included in the layer
    with also leads to the loss of information under that field. 
    The image below shows how you can include and exclude fields. 
</p>
<img src="../../images/choose_layer_fields.png">
<p>By default, the id column will be added and it can't be removed.</p>
<p>All fields except the feature_type and file_name are extracted from
    the gpx file. </p>
<h2>Starting the Import Process</h2>
<p>Once you finish specifying the required form fields, you can start importing
    the GPX features by clicking on the <strong>Import</strong> button as shown in the
    image below.
</p>
<img src="../../images/start_importing.png">
<p>Once you click on the import button, you will see a progress dialog and the
    Log tab page appearing and showing the import progress as shown below.</p>
<img src="../../images/importing_progress.PNG">
<p>Once complete, you will see a success message and a new layer added to the
    Layers panel as shown in the image below. </p>

can view the description of each form field. To activate it, click on the
<strong>Show Dynamic Help</strong> button located at the bottom. This will
show the Dynamic Help box on the right side of the dialog as shown below.</p>
