<h1>Batch GPS Importer</h1>
<h2>GPX Folder</h2>
<p>Choose the folder in which the gpx files reside
    by clicking on the Browser button. </p>
<h2>Scan Sub-folders</h2>
<p>Click on <strong>Yes</strong> to import gpx files in sub-folders or
    <strong>No</strong> to only import from the currently selected folder. </p>
<h2>GPX Format</h2>
<p>Choose one GPX format which could be track, waypoint, or route.
This is determined during the GPS data collection. </p>
<h2>Layer Name</h2>
<p>Specify a name for the output layer.
    If not specified, the default layer will be used.</p>
<h2>Geometry Type</h2>
<p>Choose the geometry type of the output Layer.
    It can be Polygon, Line or Point. If you choose Polygon and Line,
    only the first attributes of each feature will be used. For Point
    geometry type, all point attributes are captured. </p>
<h2>Projection</h2>
<p>Choose the coordinate reference system used when collecting the GPS points.
    This will also be used as the layer projection. </p>
<h2>Exclude Outside Extent</h2>
<p>When this extent box is activated, it automatically captures the extent of
    the map. When you click on the Import button, this extent will be used to
    crop other features outside the visible map extent. </p>
<h2>Exclude with Geometry Errors</h2>
<p>Choose to exclude or include features with geometry error. If you click
    Yes, features with geometry error will be excluded and the error message
    and the gpx files will be shown in the log tab. </p>
<h2>Exclude with Insufficient Points</h2>
<p>Exclude or include GPX features with insufficient point that is not
    enough to create a valid geometry. This filter is applicable for lines
and polygons. For line, the minimum points required are 2. For polygon,
    the minimum required points are 3. </p>
<p>If you click on the Yes radio button,
    features with points below the required number will be excluded.
    If you click on the No button, features with points below the
    required number will be included. This could lead to the presence features
    with no visible geometry.</p>
<h2>Valid GPX Folder</h2>
<p>If you would like to filter out and keep the valid gpx files used in
    the output layer. Select a folder. If not specified,
    the valid gpx files will not be copied.</p>
<h2>Invalid GPX Folder</h2>
<p>If you would like to identify invalid gpx files that are not used in
    the output layer. Select a folder. If not specified,
    the invalid gpx files will not be copied.</p>
<h2>Choose Layer Fields</h2>
<p>You can include or exclude layer fields that will be added in the map.
If you remove the check of a field, it will not be included in the layer
with also leads to the loss of information under that field.
</p>
<p>By default, the id column will be added and it can't be removed.</p>
